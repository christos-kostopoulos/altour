The water gushing from the village springs is bottled at the local automatic bottling plant whcih was built by the French during the first World War, for their soldiers’ water needs. Scientific research has confirmed the beneficial effect of this water mainly on the kidneys but also on the liver of humans. The water coming from the springs of Sour Water is bottled in the automatic bottling plant that has been operating since 1958. The area of Sour Water is rich in water reserves of mineral water.

In 1992 it came under the ownership of the then community of Xino Nero as a pure community enterprise.
