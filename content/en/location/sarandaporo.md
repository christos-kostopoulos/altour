<ins>Sarandoporou Springs in Vronomero, Leskovikk</ins>

The lesser-known springs of Leskovik are located on the northern side of Sarandoporou, on the Albania-Greece border, 10 km south of Leskovik. Also known as Vronomero springs, these thermal waters contain an abundance of minerals that help treat many ailments. Their temperature ranges from 29 to 40 degrees Celsius. These thermal baths are considered a somewhat "secret treasure" not only of Leskovik, but of the whole country, but the level of their exploration remains low compared to other sources in the country. The spring temp is approximately 27.6 degrees, and the water is potable.
