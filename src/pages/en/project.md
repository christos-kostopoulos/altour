<p><strong>The overall objective</strong> of the project is the enhancement and sustainability of thermal tourism by highlighting/promoting thermal natural springs in the cross-border area of Greece – Albania, mainly through the development of a strategic marketing plan, benchmarking, branding techniques and investment in skills development through the training and cooperation of all stakeholders in tourism. </p>
<p>
Although significant efforts have been made in both countries, thermal tourism resorts in the cross-border region are lagging behind those of their European counterparts, mainly due to their management by local authorities and the lack of involvement of private initiative.
</p>
<p>
Based on the above, the "ALTTOUR" act attempts to integrate into the wider environment functional connections with the already existing comparative advantages related to cultural and natural resources and to include them in "tourist routes" packages.
</p>
<p>
For this purpose, the act focuses on the creation of customized tourist packages that will include a visit to the thermal spring along with a guided tour in cultural interest places in the cross-border area.
</p>

<p><span class="is-underlined">More specifically,</span> the project aims to respond to the following challenges:
</p>

<p>A) Identification of the advantages & disadvantages of tourist market needs in the cross-border area of the thermal springs</p>
<p>B) Enhancement and sustainability of thermal tourism in the cross-border area of Greece -Albania</p>
<p>C) Creation of a common branding strategy through targeted marketing actions as well as pilot actions</p>
